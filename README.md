# SorterW - v1.1

## What is it?
**SorterW** is an open-source project that helps you quickly sort your files.  
The best part is that you can configure your own file types!  
Just open `properties.types` and change or add types. It's simple because it uses a **JSON** structure.

---

## Commands
Now that the program doesn't have many commands. However, I can highlight some.

` > sort` - opens a window to choose the folder in which files will be sorted. 

` > sort -s=folder-path` - is the same as just `sort`, but you write the path directly in the terminal. 

` > --version` - checks current version.

` > quit` or ` > exit` - exits the program :|



## ✅ Fixes
- Fixed the issue with spaces in paths in the terminal. Example: `C:\Users\Your Name\folder`
- The terminal became more beautiful.

## 🟠 TODO
1. Fix issues related to the label.
2. Add more commands
3. Improve terminal interface.
4. Improve UX.
5. Develop a graphical UI.

## ⚠️ Note
This project has just started, so it is improving over time!
