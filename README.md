# SorterW - v1.2

## What is it?
**SorterW** is an open-source project that helps you quickly sort your files.  
The best part is that you can configure your own file types!  
Just open `properties.types` and change or add types. It's simple because it uses a **JSON** structure.

## Commands
` > sort` → opens a window to choose the folder in which files will be sorted.  
` > sort -s=folder-path` → is the same as just `sort`, but you write the path directly in the terminal.  
` > conf` → opens `properties.types`  
` > rmempty` → opens a window to choose the folder in which empty folders will be deleted.  
` > rmempty -s=folder-path` → is the same as just `rmempty`, but you write the path directly in the terminal.  
` > --version` → shows current version.  
` > quit` or ` > exit` → exits the program :|
